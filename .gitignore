# 2️⃣ Lesson APIs (Teacher side)

# These let teachers add lessons to a course:

# POST /lessons → Add lesson

# video/pdf/live

# For live, include start/end + meeting link

# PUT /lessons/:id → Update lesson

# Add recordings for live lessons

# Change video/pdf files if needed

# DELETE /lessons/:id → Remove lesson




# 3️⃣ Student side APIs

# GET /courses → List all available courses

# GET /courses/:id/lessons → List all lessons in a course (respect isPreview and enrollment)

# POST /enroll/:courseId → Enroll in a course

# GET /progress/:courseId → Get progress for the student (later)



# 4️⃣ Enrollment & Progress Tracking

# Create a separate Enrollment schema:

# userId, courseId, lessonsCompleted[]

# Update progress when student completes a lesson

# This lets you show “Course 50% complete” etc.







# 6️⃣ Next logical step

# Build Course APIs first (create, list, get, update, delete)

# Then Lesson APIs (add lessons, upload video/pdf, schedule live)

# Then Enrollment APIs for students

# Once this is done, your backend will be fully functional, and you can move to frontend integration.
